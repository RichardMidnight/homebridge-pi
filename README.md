# homebridge-pi
Homebridge for raspberry pi 2020

Homebridge is very cool. I struggled to get it installed and working on a Raspberry Pi. I tried so many different combinations and bits of information, that I finally coded it all into an installation script. install.homebridge-pi.sh

It correctly installs on a probably any raspberry pi running Raspbian Buster or Raspbian Stretch including the lite versions. I used a 3b+ and a 4 with the standard raspbian for most of the development.

It installs the prerequisites, homebridge, homebridge service, config-ui, and sets all the config files so they work.
